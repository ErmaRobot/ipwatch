ipwatch - Utility for keeping DNS records up-to-date with public IP of host machine

ipwatch uses pre-defined or user defined methods for learning the public IP of the host machine and then update cloudflare DNS with the new ip address. Methods for acquiring the public IP are stored in the method directory. Each method is stored as its own .py file and must define the getIP function. How they go about getIP is their business. Which method is used by ipwatch is set in the configuration file, ipwConfig.py, as well as the directory methods are held in. Logging directory, files, and line formatting are also stored in ipwConfig.py, and can be changed by the end user if they choose. Parameters are given to the main script through the config file and environment variables, and the logic is performed in the main script.The main script, ipwatch, is sym-linked from the src directory to the upper ipwatch directory should not be changed.

ipwatch is meant to be called via a shell script that will set necessary environment variables such as, zone, dns_record, name, authorization token. These variable are uniue to each user and should be kept private. Using the shell script keeps those variables out of the source code, and, if the user has sudo priviledges, the script can be owned by root so that it can only be viewed with password authorization.

Cron or some similar job scheduler needs to be used to periodically run ipwatch with the user defined shell script.
